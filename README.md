**Project**: 

DNA Sequencing Analysis of Medulloblastoma Samples

**Overview**

This project involves the targeted sequencing of 49 medulloblastoma samples using Illumina MiSeq technology. The sequencing strategy employed is Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS), providing high-resolution data for analyzing coding regions of the genome.

**Dataset Information**

**Objective**

The aim of this analysis is to process and analyze DNA sequencing data for identifying potential mutations and genomic variations associated with medulloblastoma. This will involve quality control, read alignment, variant calling, and downstream analysis to gain insights into the genetic landscape of these samples.
